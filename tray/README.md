============
### Introduction

Implementation and solving of sliding block puzzles. 

"For this project, you will be writing a program to solve sliding block puzzles. These puzzles consist of a
number of rectangular blocks in a tray. The goal is to slide the pieces without lifting any out of the tray until
a certain configuration is achieved."

This project has two required components as well as an extra credit portion:

  1. Checker: reads initial and goal configurations, and accepts sequences of moves
  2. Solver: reads initial and goal configurations, and prints a sequence of solving moves
  3. Optional: contest for fastest solver

### Grading 

This project is worth 30 course points. The grade breakdown is as follows:
  
  * Code correctness and efficiency: 20 points
     * Solving all easy puzzles in <80 seconds each: 8 points. All or nothing.
     * Solving hard puzzles in <80 seconds each: 8 points. 0.3 points per puzzle, capped at 8.
     * Correct exit statuses for Checker: 2 points
     * Correct exit statuses for Solver: 2 points
  * Readme.pdf: 10 points
     * Division of labor (1/2 page)
     * Design (2-3 pages)
     * Experimental results (1-2 pages per experiment, 3 experiments)
     * Program development (1 page)
     * Disclaimers
     * Improvements (1/2 page)

### Checkpoint checkoff

There will be a project checkpoint checkoff in lab on Monday August 11. To receive full points, your team
must demonstrate to your TA that your Checker program is fully functional. Your team must also have a
draft of your readme.pdf file, specifically the “Division of Labor” and the “Design” portions.

### Submission

Submit project 3 on an instructional machine with the command submit proj3 by Friday August 15,
10pm PDT. As with project 2, you must submit with a team of 3-4. Your submission must include the
following files:

  * Checker.java
  * Solver.java
  * readme.pdf

in addition to all other Java files you wrote for this project. Only one member should submit per team.
Within 24 hours of submitting your project, each team member must submit a group evaluation form. Failure
to do so will result in a 1 point penalty. Project grades will be adjusted based on these responses.
